# Postmortem: The Great Web Stack Outage Odyssey

## Introduction:
Welcome, fellow adventurers, to the epic tale of our recent journey through the treacherous seas of server outages and misconfigurations. Grab your swords (or keyboards) and join us as we recount the heroic saga of the Web Stack Outage Incident!

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** From the crack of dawn on May 10, 2024, until the sun reached its zenith, lasting until 11:00 AM UTC.
- **Impact:** A catastrophic event that plunged our entire web application into the abyss of darkness, leaving 100% of our users stranded in the digital void.

## Root Cause:
Picture this: a mischievous misconfiguration lurking within the depths of our load balancer settings, silently wreaking havoc on our unsuspecting servers.

## Timeline:
- **08:00 AM UTC:** Our journey begins with a foreboding alarm echoing through the halls of our server room, signaling trouble on the horizon.
- **08:05 AM UTC:** Like valiant knights, our engineers set forth on a quest to vanquish the perceived database dragon causing the disturbance.
- **08:20 AM UTC:** Alas, the dragon proved elusive, leaving our heroes scratching their heads and pondering alternative foes.
- **08:45 AM UTC:** With no dragon in sight, our tale took a comedic turn as we chased after phantom network ghosts, only to find our efforts fruitless.
- **09:15 AM UTC:** Faced with defeat, our brave adventurers sought counsel from the wise wizards of the network operations team.
- **10:00 AM UTC:** Lo and behold! The true culprit, a mischievous misconfiguration, revealed itself, lurking within the shadows of the load balancer.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** With a swift stroke of the keyboard, our heroes corrected the misconfiguration, restoring peace to the kingdom of servers.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
The mischievous misconfiguration within the load balancer settings was swiftly defeated by our intrepid engineers, restoring balance to the digital realm.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
In the aftermath of our grand adventure, we've taken measures to fortify our defenses and prevent future incursions into the realm of server chaos:
1. Regular load balancer configuration audits to keep misconfigurations at bay.
2. Implementation of automated alerts to sound the alarm at the first sign of trouble.
3. Strengthening of alliances between engineering and network operations teams to face future challenges united.
4. Scheduled routine load testing to prepare our servers for whatever trials lie ahead.
5. Documentation of our epic journey in an incident response plan, ensuring that future generations may learn from our triumphs and tribulations.

## Conclusion:
And so, dear reader, our tale draws to a close. But fear not, for though the journey was perilous, it has made us stronger and wiser. Until the next adventure beckons, may your servers remain stable and your load balancers true!
